# ecmacro

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An R package for downloading the latest data from the European Commission's AMECO macro-economic database.

https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-research-and-databases/economic-databases/ameco-database_en

## Installation

You can install the development version of ecmacro from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("xprimexinverse/ecmacro")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(ecmacro)
library(devtools)
load_all()

# Download the data
AMECO <- get_ecmacro()

# Search by CODE (1)
#find_series(AMECO, "zutn", field = 1) 

# Search by COUNTRY (2)
#find_series(AMECO, "Ireland", field = 2)

# Search by SUB-CHAPTER (3)
#find_series(AMECO, "population", field = 3)

# Search by TITLE (4)
#find_series(AMECO, "unemployment", field = 4)

# Extract and plot a series
ZUTN <- get_series(AMECO, "IRL.1.0.0.0.ZUTN")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
